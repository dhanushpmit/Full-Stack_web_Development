Long running branches & short lived branches
  long:
    Exist through the complete lifetime of the project.
    Every git repo will contain atleast one long running branch,typically something called main or master.
    They also called integration branches.
        commaon convention and no direct commits!
  Short:
    For new features,bug fixes,refactories,experiments.
    Will be deleted after integration.
  Two examples branching strategies:
      -Github flow
      -Git flow
  Github dlow
    very simple:only one long-running branch("main")+feature branches.
  Git flow
    -more structures,morerules
    -long running:"main"+"develop"
    -short lived:features,releases hot fixes.
  Warning notice:
     Do not use rebase on commits that you've already pushed on a remote repository.
