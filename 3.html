    <h1>Microsoft Edge</h1>
    <p>Microsoft Edge is a proprietary, cross-platform web browser created by Microsoft. It was first released in 2015 as part of Windows 10 and Xbox One and later ported to other platforms as a fork of Google's Chromium open-source project: Android and iOS,[5][6] macOS, older Windows versions (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later),[7][8] and most recently Linux.[9][10] It was created as the successor to Internet Explorer (IE).</p>
    <p>Edge was initially built with Microsoft's own proprietary browser engine, EdgeHTML, and their Chakra JavaScript engine.[11] In late 2018, it was announced that Edge would be completely rebuilt as a Chromium-based[12][13] browser with Blink and V8 engines. The new Edge was publicly released in January 2020,[14][15] and on Xbox platforms in 2021.[16][17] Microsoft has since terminated security support for the original browser (now referred to as Microsoft Edge Legacy),[18] and in Windows 11 it is the default web browser (for compatibility[19][20] with Google Chrome).[21]</p>
