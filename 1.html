    <h1>Google Chrome</h1>
    <p>Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox.[15] Versions were later released for Linux, macOS, iOS, and also for Android, where it is the default browser.[16] The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.</p>
    <p> Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware.[14] WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;[17] all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.[18]</p>
